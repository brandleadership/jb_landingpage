# JB Landingpage Design

ALERT: The content created by this design is coupled to a Censhare integration. The most important consequence of this 
is that, once created, BSI Element names cannot be modified anymore. The design has been initiated with a very weird 
structure and Element names which make it hard to quickly identify which element is which. 

That's why the design has been refactored to follow the structural guidelines of the boilerplate design. But, as you
will notice, the element names will partially be the BSI Element names of the initial setup (and again, this cannot
be changed). To facilitate your work, the BSI Element folder names have been adapted to match the respective Element
Name labels of the BSI Editor. Use the folder names, combined with the word doc illustrating the mapping in this 
repository, to quickly identify the elements / allowed elements for dropzones.
