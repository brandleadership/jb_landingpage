# JB Landingpage Design

The BSI Landingpage Design for Julius Baer.

> **ALERT:** The content created by this design is coupled to a Censhare integration. This means, BSI Element Names _CAN NOT_ be changed. As a result, folder names sometimes differ from BSI Element Names. Please use the overview in the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/brandleadership/jb_landingpage/wiki/Notes-from-Refactoring) as a reference.
